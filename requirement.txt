A client of mine wants an app built for highlevel for whatsapp. Where once the app is activated instead of sending sms it sends a whatsapp message. 
ChatGPT said:
To ensure I provide the best possible guidance, could you clarify a few details:

Is the client looking for a direct integration with HighLevel using an API, or a middleware app that bridges HighLevel and WhatsApp?
Should the WhatsApp messages be sent via WhatsApp Business API (official API) or personal WhatsApp numbers using automation tools?
Does the client want additional features like message tracking, templates, or automated responses?
Should the app work for all messaging scenarios in HighLevel (e.g., campaigns, workflows, reminders) or specific use cases?
Let me know these details so I can provide the best solution!







You said:
a middle ware app that bridges highlevel and whatsapp or may be API. Whatever is best. However I want the SMS feature to be overriden and replaced with whatsapp message. tracking and templates and automated features should work like they usually work for highlevel sms feature.

Introduction
Integrating GoHighLevel (HighLevel) with WhatsApp can significantly improve engagement by using WhatsApp messages in place of SMS. The goal is to build a middleware application that bridges HighLevel and the WhatsApp Business API so that all automated SMS in HighLevel workflows are sent via WhatsApp instead – all while preserving HighLevel’s tracking, message templates, and automation capabilities. This report outlines HighLevel’s API capabilities for messaging, the options for integrating WhatsApp’s API, middleware design choices (self-hosted vs third-party), compliance considerations, implementation steps to override SMS with WhatsApp, potential challenges with solutions, cost factors, and recommended tools/services. The approach is actionable and technical, enabling a seamless replacement of SMS with WhatsApp in HighLevel workflows.
HighLevel SMS Capabilities and API
HighLevel is built with omnichannel communication in mind – it natively supports SMS through Twilio or its own “LeadConnector” phone system. By default, HighLevel lets you connect a Twilio account or buy a number via LeadConnector to send/receive SMS​
GOHIGHLEVELINFO.COM
. HighLevel’s automation (Workflows/Campaigns) can use SMS steps with personalization tokens and templates, and all messages appear in the Conversations tab with status tracking (sent, delivered, etc.). Technically, HighLevel provides APIs to manage conversations and messages. For example, there are API endpoints to send a new message (creating an outgoing SMS or other message in a conversation) and to log incoming messages​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
. HighLevel is transitioning from a legacy API to a newer API 2.0 (OAuth-based) for these functions​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
.Notably, HighLevel now allows custom messaging providers in place of Twilio. This means you can configure a custom service as the default channel for outbound messages. In such cases, HighLevel will invoke an outbound webhook (through its Integration API) whenever a user’s workflow tries to send a message​
HIGHLEVEL.STOPLIGHT.IO
. Essentially, HighLevel hands off the message payload to your custom provider, expecting that service to deliver the message and report back status. This is exactly the hook our middleware can leverage: by registering as a custom SMS/WhatsApp provider, we can intercept HighLevel’s outgoing SMS events and reroute them to WhatsApp. HighLevel’s documentation confirms this provider mechanism: “Called whenever a user sends a message to a contact and has a custom provider as the default channel in the settings.”​
HIGHLEVEL.STOPLIGHT.IO
. Through this, the middleware can maintain HighLevel’s internal tracking – logging the message in the HighLevel conversation thread and updating statuses – even though the delivery happens via WhatsApp. HighLevel also supports workflow actions for HTTP webhooks​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
, which is another way to send data to an external service if a full provider replacement isn’t used (for example, using a webhook step instead of the SMS step in a workflow).HighLevel’s template features can be reused as well. Users can create message templates in HighLevel (e.g. common follow-up texts) and personalize them with contact merge fields​
GOHIGHLEVELINFO.COM
. These can still be utilized in workflows; the content will simply be sent over WhatsApp instead of SMS. HighLevel’s upcoming native WhatsApp integration (currently in beta) is designed to mirror SMS functionality, including campaigns and even AI bots over WhatsApp​
GOHIGHLEVELINFO.COM
. This indicates that with the right integration, WhatsApp can support the same automation features (bulk messaging, triggers on replies, etc.) as SMS. Our middleware approach will emulate this: preserving the automation triggers (like workflow steps, conversational triggers) and template usage by translating HighLevel’s SMS intents into WhatsApp messages. In summary, HighLevel’s API and flexible provider model give us the hooks to send messages via external channels while keeping HighLevel informed, which is key to maintaining tracking and automation continuity.
WhatsApp Business API – Options and Integration Methods
The WhatsApp Business API allows businesses to send WhatsApp messages at scale, but it’s quite different from consumer WhatsApp or simple SMS – it requires registration of a business account, phone number verification, and adherence to specific messaging rules. When integrating WhatsApp, you essentially have two main routes:
Use a Business Solution Provider (BSP): Companies like Twilio, MessageBird, Vonage, 360dialog, etc., offer WhatsApp API access as a service. Twilio is a popular choice, especially since HighLevel already integrates with Twilio for SMS. Twilio’s API for WhatsApp works via the same messaging endpoints as SMS, but with a special address format. For example, to send a WhatsApp message via Twilio, you use the prefix whatsapp: in front of the phone number​
TWILIO.COM
. Twilio’s onboarding will link your Twilio number to a WhatsApp Business Account (through Meta’s approval). Using Twilio has the advantage of unified APIs – HighLevel can potentially call Twilio’s API and Twilio decides whether to send via SMS or WhatsApp based on how you format the request. (However, note that HighLevel’s native Twilio integration by default sends SMS; to send WhatsApp you’d need to adjust the integration or use a custom approach.) Other BSPs like MessageBird or 360dialog similarly provide endpoints to send WhatsApp messages after you onboard a number. Each BSP may have slight differences in API and pricing (e.g. Twilio and MessageBird charge a per-message fee on top of WhatsApp costs​
DOCS.OCTOPODS.IO
, whereas 360dialog uses a flat monthly fee model​
DOCS.OCTOPODS.IO
).
Use WhatsApp Cloud API (Direct from Meta): Meta (Facebook) launched the Cloud API which allows businesses to use the WhatsApp Business Platform without an intermediary. This involves creating a WhatsApp Business Account in Meta’s Business Manager, verifying your business, and then using Meta’s Graph API endpoints to send messages. This is a self-service approach – you host no servers for WhatsApp (Meta hosts the endpoint), but you do need to write code to call their API and handle webhooks. The Cloud API is often cost-effective because Meta only charges per conversation (session) as per WhatsApp’s pricing, with no additional per-message fee (unlike Twilio). For example, as of 2025 Meta charges a rate per 24-hour conversation (differing by template category and region), and the first 1,000 user-initiated conversations each month are free. The trade-off is that you manage the integration logic yourself.
In either case, you must have a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) and an approved phone number for the API. The integration process usually involves: connecting a phone number (can be a Twilio number, a number you own, or one provided by a BSP) to the WhatsApp Business platform, verifying a Meta Business Manager (to prove your business identity), and setting up webhooks for incoming messages. Twilio’s guide, for instance, walks through enabling WhatsApp on a Twilio number by linking your Meta Business Manager and verifying the number​
TWILIO.COM
​
TWILIO.COM
. Once set up, you obtain API credentials: for Twilio, this is just your Account SID/Auth Token plus enabling the WhatsApp sender; for Meta’s API, this involves an access token for the Graph API and a webhook signing secret.Which integration method to choose? If you want to leverage HighLevel’s existing Twilio integration, using Twilio’s WhatsApp might seem straightforward – but note that HighLevel’s UI doesn’t natively have a “send via WhatsApp” toggle (unless using their beta feature). Therefore, a middleware might still be needed to ensure HighLevel sends requests in the correct format (whatsapp: prefix) or to use Twilio’s Conversations API for cross-channel messaging. Some developers opt to not use Twilio at all and go direct with the WhatsApp Cloud API for cost reasons or to avoid Twilio’s extra fees. Both approaches can work with a middleware: the middleware can either call Twilio’s API (with WhatsApp sender) or call Meta’s API directly. The decision may depend on cost, complexity, and how much you’re already invested in Twilio. For example, Twilio abstracts some details (like template registration and messaging windows) and provides SDKs, whereas the Cloud API might require manual handling of templates and sessions but could be cheaper at scale.In summary, the WhatsApp Business API integration can be done via a third-party provider (e.g. Twilio) or directly with Meta’s Cloud API. Twilio integration is bolstered by HighLevel’s existing Twilio support (since HighLevel “speaks Twilio” for SMS, it can be adapted to Twilio WhatsApp with minimal changes), whereas a direct Cloud API integration gives full control and potentially lower cost. The middleware we build will hide these details from HighLevel – it will accept a message request from HighLevel and then decide whether to call Twilio or the WhatsApp Cloud API on the back end to deliver the message.
Middleware Design: Self-Hosted vs Third-Party Solutions
Building a self-hosted middleware is often the most flexible approach. This means writing a custom application (for example, a Node.js/Express server, Python FastAPI/Flask app, etc.) that acts as the bridge between HighLevel and WhatsApp. The responsibilities of this middleware include: receiving outbound message instructions from HighLevel (via webhook or API call), transforming them into WhatsApp API calls, sending the message through WhatsApp, and then reporting back any status or receiving any inbound replies to forward into HighLevel. A self-hosted solution gives you full control – you can implement custom logic like message formatting, fallbacks, logging, and adhere to compliance exactly as needed. You also own the data flow, which can be important for privacy. The downside is the development and maintenance overhead: you’ll need to host the service (e.g. on AWS, Heroku, etc.), handle scaling if sending a high volume of messages, and monitor updates to both HighLevel and WhatsApp APIs.Third-party integration services provide an alternative if you want less custom code. There are a few categories here:
Integration Platforms (iPaaS): Tools like Zapier, Make (Integromat), Pipedream, or n8n can connect HighLevel to WhatsApp with minimal code. For example, you could have a HighLevel workflow trigger a webhook, which Zapier catches and then sends a WhatsApp message via Twilio. Pipedream even has pre-built components for HighLevel API and Twilio API​
PIPEDREAM.COM
, making it relatively quick to set up a workflow that sends WhatsApp when an event occurs in HighLevel. The advantage is speed of setup and no need to manage your own server. However, the disadvantages include cost scaling (these platforms often charge per task or operation – sending each message might count as tasks) and limited real-time tracking (you might not easily feed delivery status back into HighLevel). They can be great for prototyping or low-volume use, but a custom solution is usually more robust for heavy use.
Specialized WhatsApp Integrations for HighLevel: As WhatsApp is a highly requested feature, some third-party vendors have already built solutions. For example, HighLevel’s own marketplace or community mentions tools like “CRM Messaging” or “Inst8 SMS Gateway”. Inst8 is an interesting case where they let you use an Android phone as an SMS gateway to integrate with HighLevel​
GHLCENTRAL.COM
, but more relevant are services offering WhatsApp bridging. Some services claim “send and receive WhatsApp natively in HighLevel” by essentially acting as the middleware for you​
CRM-MESSAGING.CLOUD
. If such a service is trusted, it could save you from re-inventing the wheel – you’d essentially subscribe to their gateway, configure HighLevel to use their API key as a custom provider​
GHLCENTRAL.COM
, and they handle the WhatsApp delivery. The trade-off here is vendor lock-in and cost; you’ll pay a subscription or message fees to that provider and rely on them to stay up-to-date. For example, one provider charges a monthly fee per WhatsApp number and passes through WhatsApp fees​
DOCS.OCTOPODS.IO
​

.
HighLevel’s Native WhatsApp (Beta): Lastly, consider if HighLevel’s own solution could fit your needs once available. HighLevel is beta-testing native WhatsApp support​
GOHIGHLEVELINFO.COM
, which when released would allow you to send WhatsApp directly from workflows (similar to SMS) without any custom middleware. It works by integrating with the WhatsApp Cloud API through the HighLevel interface (you’d link your Facebook Business account and number in HighLevel settings)​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
. If timing or control is an issue (perhaps the feature isn’t fully out or you need more customization), the custom middleware remains viable. But in the long run, HighLevel’s native feature could be the simplest (though note that HighLevel may charge a markup or require a certain subscription for WhatsApp usage​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
).
Comparison: A self-hosted middleware is recommended if you need maximum flexibility (custom business logic, specialized compliance handling, or want to minimize recurring costs by doing it in-house). It does require programming expertise in using both HighLevel’s API and WhatsApp’s API. A third-party integration (whether iPaaS or a dedicated connector) can get you up and running faster with less code, but you may sacrifice some fine-grained control and possibly pay more as your message volume grows. Many agencies start with a third-party to validate the concept, then invest in a custom solution if the volume and importance of WhatsApp channel increases.In any case, the middleware should aim to maintain HighLevel’s automation flow – meaning HighLevel still “thinks” it’s executing a normal step (so workflows, triggers, and campaign metrics continue to function). The middleware should be mostly transparent to the end user and HighLevel user, aside from initial setup.
WhatsApp Policy Compliance and Considerations
When replacing SMS with WhatsApp, it’s crucial to comply with WhatsApp’s messaging policies. WhatsApp is more restrictive than SMS in terms of who you can message and what you can send. Key compliance points include:
User Opt-In: You must obtain explicit consent (opt-in) from each user before sending them WhatsApp messages, especially business-initiated messages. WhatsApp’s rules (and Twilio’s guidelines) are clear that an application should implement explicit user opt-in for WhatsApp​
TWILIO.COM
. This opt-in can be collected via a web form, a checkbox in your app, SMS confirmation, etc., but it needs to be clear and documented. Users should know they’ll receive WhatsApp messages and agree to it. If you send WhatsApp messages without prior consent, users may block or report your number. Not only does this harm deliverability, it can lead to WhatsApp warning or even suspending your business account​
TWILIO.COM
. In practice, ensure your HighLevel funnels include a step where a lead opts in (for example, via a form or a keyword reply like “YES” on WhatsApp or SMS indicating consent to WhatsApp communication). Keep records of these opt-ins outside HighLevel as well, since you might need to prove compliance if Meta audits your account.
Template Messages and the 24-Hour Rule: WhatsApp distinguishes between session messages (within a 24-hour window after the user’s last message) and template messages (outside that window or unsolicited notifications). Within 24 hours of a user’s message, you can freely chat (similar to live chat) – this would cover scenarios like responding to an inquiry or ongoing conversation. Beyond 24 hours, you cannot send a free-form message; you may only send pre-approved template messages. Message templates are pre-approved formats for outbound communication, often used for notifications, reminders, or marketing messages that are not replies to a user’s inquiry​
SEAMPIFY.COM
. Each template must be submitted to and approved by WhatsApp (Meta) before use​
SEAMPIFY.COM
. For example, a “Appointment Reminder” template might read: “Hello {{1}}, this is a reminder for your appointment on {{2}} at {{3}}. Reply 1 to confirm or 2 to reschedule.” You can then send that template with the placeholders filled. Any HighLevel automated message that goes out without a preceding user message (like a campaign blast or a follow-up after a day) will likely need to use a WhatsApp template. Therefore, as you shift SMS content to WhatsApp, you should identify all the messages that are sent outside the 24-hour interaction window (e.g. next-day follow-ups, promotional offers, re-engagement texts) and create corresponding WhatsApp templates for them. Submit those for approval in your WhatsApp Business Account. It’s wise to mirror your SMS templates in WhatsApp format ahead of time so you’re ready to go. Remember, “beyond the initial 24 hours from a customer’s message, only approved templates may be used to continue the conversation”​
SEAMPIFY.COM
. Within 24 hours, your middleware can send the actual message content directly as a session message; outside 24 hours, it must send a template ID with parameters instead.
Content Restrictions: WhatsApp’s Business Policy is strict about certain content. It disallows spam, harassment, illegal offers, etc. For marketing messages, overly promotional language can get templates rejected. Ensure your messages (and templates) follow the WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy​
BUSINESS.WHATSAPP.COM
. For instance, don’t send random broadcast messages to users who haven’t shown interest, avoid using WhatsApp for alcohol, tobacco, adult content promotions, etc., as these can violate policy. In addition, each template is approved per category (transactional, marketing, OTP, etc.), and WhatsApp will monitor user feedback (like blocks and reports). Keep your message quality high and relevant to the user. HighLevel’s automation should be adjusted to avoid spamming – e.g., if someone doesn’t respond after a few WhatsApp messages, consider stopping or switching channel.
Opt-Out Management: Unlike SMS which often uses “STOP” to opt-out, WhatsApp doesn’t have a universal keyword – users can simply block the business or ask to be removed. It’s good practice to offer an opt-out mechanism. For example, you can include “Reply STOP to unsubscribe” (WhatsApp will not automatically process this, but your middleware can treat it as a signal to not send further messages and perhaps mark the contact opt-out in HighLevel). Also, if a user does send “STOP” or any opt-out intent on WhatsApp, honor it promptly – update their communication preferences, and perhaps use HighLevel’s contact fields/tags to mark them as do-not-contact for WhatsApp. This kind of compliance step ensures you don’t accidentally violate policies. WhatsApp expects businesses to respect opt-out and block signals to maintain high quality rating​
TWILIO.COM
.
In short, to comply with WhatsApp’s rules: only message users who have opted in, use approved templates for any proactive messages (outside the customer service window), keep content compliant and relevant, and implement an opt-out or stop mechanism. Incorporate these into your middleware logic. For example, the middleware could check a contact’s opt-in status (maybe stored in a custom field in HighLevel or your database) before sending; it could also decide whether to use a template based on last contact time. Compliance isn’t just ethical, it protects your WhatsApp Business number from being banned, which would defeat the whole integration.
Steps to Implement WhatsApp in HighLevel Workflows (Replacing SMS)
Replacing SMS with WhatsApp in HighLevel involves configuring both platforms and the middleware. Below are the actionable steps to achieve this:
Set Up WhatsApp API Access: First, obtain access to the WhatsApp Business API. If you choose Twilio:
Connect a Number to WhatsApp via Twilio: Ensure you have a Twilio phone number (or purchase one) and follow Twilio’s WhatsApp onboarding (in Twilio Console, Messaging > Senders > WhatsApp). You’ll need to submit your Facebook Business Manager info and verify the number for WhatsApp​
TWILIO.COM
​
TWILIO.COM
. Twilio will guide you through getting a WhatsApp Business Account approved and connecting it. Once done, your Twilio number becomes WhatsApp-enabled.
WhatsApp Templates (Twilio): In Twilio’s Console, register the message templates you plan to use (under Messaging > Senders > WhatsApp Templates). Twilio will submit them to WhatsApp for approval​
TWILIO.COM
. Alternatively, if using the Cloud API:
Create a WhatsApp Business App (Cloud API): In Facebook Business Manager, create a WhatsApp application. Reserve a phone number (this can be a number you own; it will be tied exclusively to WhatsApp and can’t have an existing WhatsApp account). Verify your Meta Business and number following the Cloud API setup. You’ll get a permanent access token or set up OAuth for the Graph API.
Register Message Templates (Cloud API): Using Meta’s Business Manager or the API, create the templates (each template with content in each language needs approval)​
SEAMPIFY.COM
.
Webhook for Incoming Messages: For either Twilio or Cloud API, set up a webhook URL endpoint (which your middleware will handle) to receive incoming messages. In Twilio, you configure this in the WhatsApp sender settings; in the Cloud API, you subscribe to messages and status events in the developer app settings. This will allow your middleware to get inbound messages and delivery reports.
Build the Middleware Application: Develop the server/app that will intermediate between HighLevel and WhatsApp. Key components of this middleware:
Receive Outgoing Message Requests: There are two primary ways to get HighLevel to send the message data to your app. One is using HighLevel’s Custom Conversation Provider feature. In HighLevel Agency settings, you can configure a custom SMS provider by providing an API endpoint (webhook URL) and auth details. Once set, whenever HighLevel needs to send a message, it will POST a payload to your endpoint​
HIGHLEVEL.STOPLIGHT.IO
. This payload will contain details like the contact’s phone number, the message content (template body or text), perhaps location (account) ID and conversation ID. The other method is to use workflow Webhook actions: instead of an SMS action, put a Webhook action in the workflow and point it to your middleware’s endpoint. Include in the payload any needed info (HighLevel allows you to send custom JSON or just pass default contact data).
Parse and Determine Message Type: When the middleware receives the request, it should determine if this needs to be sent as a normal WhatsApp text or as a template message. This involves checking if it’s within 24h of last user message. If you have the conversation ID, your middleware might call HighLevel’s API to fetch last message timestamp or store timestamps in your database. Alternatively, design your HighLevel automation such that certain messages are always templates. For example, tag some workflows as “template required”. If a template is needed, the middleware should map the content to a specific template ID. You might configure a mapping like: If HighLevel passes template_name: "Appointment Reminder", your middleware knows to invoke the WhatsApp API with your approved template “appointment_reminder_001” and fill in the variables (name, date, time, etc.) from contact data. If it’s within 24h or the message is a direct response, you can send it as a free-form text.
Send Message via WhatsApp API: Now, use the appropriate API call to send the WhatsApp message. For Twilio, you would call the Twilio Messaging API (POST /Messages endpoint) with parameters: From=whatsapp:<Your_Twilio_Number>, To=whatsapp:<Contact_Number>, and either Body=<text> or Template parameters if Twilio supports sending templates via API (Twilio does allow sending template messages by using the body that matches an approved template and setting AllowedTemplate=True or through their WhatsApp API calls). Twilio essentially forwards that to WhatsApp. For the Cloud API, you’d call the messages endpoint (e.g. POST https://graph.facebook.com/v16.0/<PhoneNumberID>/messages) with a JSON payload containing either a text object or a template object depending on the case. Your middleware should handle the HTTP request and include proper auth (Twilio SID/Token as Basic Auth, or Bearer token for Meta).
Handle API Responses: When you send the message, the API will respond with an identifier (message SID from Twilio, or message ID from WhatsApp). Capture this. Also handle errors – e.g., if the number is not opted in or not WhatsApp-enabled, you’ll get an error. Decide on fallback: you might choose to fallback to SMS (maybe use Twilio SMS) if a WhatsApp send fails with a specific error, or log the failure and mark the contact for review. This depends on your business rules (fallback is tricky – if user didn’t opt in, you shouldn’t then spam SMS either, but if it’s something like template not approved, you might notify admin).
Log Outgoing Message to HighLevel: To maintain tracking in HighLevel’s CRM, ensure the message appears in the contact’s conversation. If using the Custom Provider approach, HighLevel might automatically create a pending message in the conversation when it calls your webhook, expecting you to update it. If not, you can use HighLevel’s Conversations API to add the message. There is an “Add an inbound message” endpoint for incoming, and likely an equivalent for outbound. Alternatively, HighLevel’s conversation provider docs might specify that you respond with a status callback. In any case, you want the HighLevel conversation to show something like “(WhatsApp) Message sent: <content>” so that users can see the history. One approach is to utilize the same API endpoint that Inst8 or others use – effectively posting the message content to HighLevel via API so it’s recorded as an outbound message. For example, using the HighLevel API 2.0, you can POST /conversations/messages with the contact and location IDs to create a message record​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
. Make sure to flag it as sent via a custom channel or note it’s WhatsApp in the content, since HighLevel might not yet have a “WhatsApp” label (unless the native integration is used). This logging is important for tracking – HighLevel users can then see the WhatsApp communication alongside emails, SMS, etc., in one timeline.
Integrate Incoming WhatsApp Messages: Communication is two-way; if a lead replies on WhatsApp, you want that to show up in HighLevel (just as an incoming SMS would). Configure your middleware’s endpoint to receive incoming messages from WhatsApp. With Twilio, you set your Twilio WhatsApp number’s webhook to point to the middleware (Twilio will POST when a user messages your WhatsApp number). With Cloud API, you subscribe to the webhook events and receive a JSON payload for incoming messages. When a message comes in:
Parse the sender’s number, message text, any media, etc.
Find the corresponding contact in HighLevel. Ideally, the contact’s phone field matches the WhatsApp number (including country code). Use HighLevel API to search the contact by phone if needed.
Use HighLevel’s API to insert an inbound message into the conversation, attributed to that contact. HighLevel’s Integration API has an endpoint for adding inbound messages which would thread it into the conversation​
HIGHLEVEL.STOPLIGHT.IO
. Provide the contact and location ID, message text, and possibly a flag or channel indicator. As a result, in HighLevel’s Conversations UI, the message will appear as if the contact replied (just like an SMS reply would). This can trigger HighLevel workflows if you have any “Customer Replied” triggers, etc., enabling automation based on WhatsApp replies.
Optionally, send an auto-response or human notification. Sometimes you might want to auto-reply with a template if outside 24h or notify a user in HighLevel (could be done by HighLevel itself via workflow triggers once the inbound is logged).
Ensure Template and Variable Management: If your messages use custom fields (e.g., {{contact.first_name}} in HighLevel templates), make sure your middleware replaces those before sending to WhatsApp. HighLevel will likely send the content with placeholders replaced (if the workflow is executing, it might already inject the actual name). But double-check this. For template messages on WhatsApp, your middleware must map those dynamic parts to the template components. For example, if HighLevel says the message to send is “Hello John, your order {{order_id}} is confirmed”, and you know this corresponds to a WhatsApp template “OrderConfirm” with variables for name and order_id, you need to fill those in the API call. This step is about keeping the template personalization working across systems.
Test the End-to-End Flow: Before rolling out to all contacts, test with a small group or internally:
Pick a contact (your own WhatsApp perhaps), mark them as opted-in, trigger a HighLevel workflow (or manually send a text via the Conversations tab if that routes to your provider) and observe if the WhatsApp is received.
Test both in-session and out-of-session scenarios: if you message within 24h of a reply, do you correctly send a free-form text? If you send after 24h of no interaction, does your middleware correctly use a template and is it delivered?
Test an inbound reply: reply from WhatsApp and see if it shows in HighLevel and that any downstream automation (if configured) fires.
Adjust logging and error handling: ensure your middleware’s logs or console clearly show the flow, and handle any errors (for example, Twilio might respond with code 63016 if the user is not in WhatsApp or not opted in).
Deploy and Monitor: Deploy your middleware on a reliable hosting environment. It should be HTTPS accessible (for webhooks) and ideally have retry logic (if HighLevel’s webhook fails or WhatsApp API call fails due to a transient error, implement retry). HighLevel will usually mark a webhook as failed if your endpoint returns non-200; you might get multiple retries from them or you handle internally. Monitor the message delivery statuses. If using Twilio, you can register for Status Callbacks on message send to get delivered/read events. For the Cloud API, you get webhook events for message status (sent, delivered, read). You can use these to update message status in HighLevel via API (HighLevel might have an endpoint to update message status) so that your team knows if a WhatsApp was delivered or read. HighLevel’s API does have a way to update message status in conversations​
IDEAS.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
, so for completeness, your middleware can call that when it receives a “delivered” event from WhatsApp. This maintains end-to-end tracking: HighLevel shows sent, delivered, etc., similar to how it would with Twilio SMS.
Override SMS Triggers in Workflows: Now that your system is in place, you’ll adjust HighLevel workflows to use it. If you configured as a custom provider, you can simply replace Twilio with your provider in the location’s phone settings. All SMS steps will automatically go to your webhook instead of Twilio. If you went the webhook route on specific workflows, swap those SMS steps with your webhook action (copy the message content into the webhook JSON payload or have the webhook fetch it). Ensure all relevant automations (campaigns, trigger links for SMS, etc.) are updated to use WhatsApp or at least disabled from sending redundant SMS. Essentially, HighLevel should no longer send actual SMS through Twilio, to avoid duplicate messaging – the WhatsApp is taking over that role. Keep a backup: you might keep Twilio SMS as a fallback in case WhatsApp fails, but ideally controlled via logic, not both at same time.
By following these steps, you create a closed loop: HighLevel triggers -> middleware -> WhatsApp -> end user, and end user replies -> middleware -> HighLevel, with tracking at each stage. The result is that from the HighLevel user’s perspective, their automations still function (they see messages in the timeline, can use templates and personalization, workflows trigger on replies, etc.), but the customer receives those messages on WhatsApp instead of SMS.
Potential Challenges and Solutions
Implementing a custom integration of this nature comes with a few challenges. Here are common ones and how to address them:
HighLevel Limitations and Workarounds: If HighLevel’s API or provider mechanism is limited (for instance, maybe the custom provider webhook doesn’t include all info you need, or HighLevel expects a certain response format), you’ll need to adapt. Check HighLevel’s developer docs or community for specifics. In the interim, using workflow webhooks gives you more control over payload content (you can send custom fields, etc.). It’s also important to note that HighLevel’s API 2.0 is relatively new – ensure you use stable endpoints (the API 1.0 might have some functions not yet in 2.0, e.g., you may need to use API 1.0 for some contact or message functions until parity is achieved​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
).
Template Mapping Complexity: Maintaining a library of approved WhatsApp templates that correspond to HighLevel messages can be cumbersome. One solution is to name your templates clearly to match workflow steps, and include the template name or ID in the HighLevel message (maybe as a hidden indicator like a code in the content) so the middleware knows what to send. Alternatively, store the mapping in a config file or database within your middleware (e.g., Template “APPT_REMINDER_1” -> “Hi {{name}}, reminder for your appt on {{date}}”). During testing, verify that the actual message HighLevel would send matches an approved template or is within the 24h window. If not, your middleware should refuse to send (to avoid violation) and maybe log a warning. This might require educating your team that some messages can’t be sent on WhatsApp unless the customer interacts (or have pre-made templates).
Real-time Sync and Delays: Using webhooks should be near-instant, but any network latency could delay messages. If a message is extremely time-sensitive (like an OTP code, though OTP via WhatsApp is allowed only as template), ensure your setup is low-latency. Deploying your middleware server in a region close to both HighLevel’s servers and WhatsApp’s endpoints can reduce delay. Twilio’s infrastructure is robust, but if using Cloud API, note the Graph API is global (choose closest data center via the API URL if possible). Also, HighLevel workflow execution has its own slight delay at times; just keep overall timing in mind.
Error Handling & Fallback: WhatsApp message could fail for various reasons – user has no WhatsApp, user blocked you, template not approved, etc. You should handle these gracefully. For example, if the error is that the number is not on WhatsApp, you might choose to fallback to SMS (maybe send via Twilio SMS as a backup). But be careful – only do this if you have consent to SMS and it’s important to deliver the info. You wouldn’t want to spam via all channels. Having a fallback strategy defined is good: maybe try WhatsApp, if delivery status not confirmed in X minutes and it’s critical (like an appointment alert), then send an SMS or email as secondary. This can be coded into middleware or even handled by HighLevel (e.g., use HighLevel’s “If/Else” in workflow: wait 5 minutes, check a field “WA Delivered” set by the middleware via API, if not, then send SMS). It’s a bit advanced, but worth considering for reliability.
Inbound Message Matching: Sometimes a user’s reply might not match an existing contact if they message from a different number or format. To mitigate, enforce a format for storing phone numbers in HighLevel (always include country code, no formatting) so that when a WhatsApp comes in as +123456789, it matches the +123456789 in HighLevel. If needed, do a loose match (drop country code and try last 8-10 digits, or have a mapping table). This ensures the conversation threads correctly.
Maintaining Conversation Context: HighLevel’s conversation view might not distinguish WhatsApp vs SMS unless you indicate it. If that’s important, you might add a prefix in messages like “[WhatsApp] Hello...”, or use separate conversation channels (if HighLevel supports tagging the source). At minimum, train users (the agents) to know that from now on, the “SMS” they see might have actually been WhatsApp. This is more of a UX note than technical, but important for user adoption.
WhatsApp Rate Limits: Depending on your WhatsApp tier, you might have a limit on how many users you can message per day initially. For example, new WhatsApp Business API numbers can send template messages to a limited number of unique users in the first 24 hours (like 1K unique users) until your quality rating and tier increase. If you plan a large campaign, ensure your number’s messaging tier can handle it, or stagger the sends. Twilio and others usually handle this automatically by queuing messages, but keep an eye on any rate limit errors.
Multiple HighLevel Accounts or Numbers: If you manage multiple sub-accounts in HighLevel, you might need to handle multiple WhatsApp numbers (one per client). The middleware should be multi-tenant aware: the payload from HighLevel will indicate which location (sub-account) it’s from, so use the corresponding WhatsApp number and credentials for that client. This means storing config per HighLevel location (you might have a mapping table of Location ID -> WhatsApp API credentials). This is crucial if you’re an agency implementing for many clients.
Despite the challenges, each has a solution as described. Careful planning, testing, and incremental rollout (maybe start with one or two workflows before migrating everything) will help avoid surprises. Over time, you’ll likely refine the middleware to handle edge cases and maybe even build a small UI for it to manage templates or view logs. The investment pays off by providing a powerful communication channel to your HighLevel system.
Cost Considerations
Cost is a significant factor in choosing the best approach. Here we break down the potential costs:
WhatsApp Messaging Costs (Meta fees): WhatsApp Business API uses conversation-based pricing (as set by Meta). The cost depends on who initiates the conversation (business-initiated vs user-initiated) and the message category (marketing, utility, authentication, etc.), and varies by country. For example, a business-initiated marketing message in the US might cost a fraction of a cent per conversation, whereas in some regions it could be a cent or more. Meta provides a pricing schedule per country for these conversations. The first 1,000 user-initiated conversations per month are free. If your volume is low, you might not pay Meta at all. But for scale, you will pay per conversation per 24h window per user.
Twilio (or BSP) Fees: If you use Twilio or a similar provider, they will add their own charges on top of Meta’s fees. Twilio charges a flat $0.005 per message (sent or received)​
DOCS.OCTOPODS.IO
. That means for every WhatsApp message (outbound or inbound) you pay half a cent to Twilio, plus the WhatsApp conversation fee if applicable. This could roughly double the cost of each message when conversation fees are low. Over many messages, that markup is significant. Other BSPs have different models: MessageBird similarly charges around $0.005 per message, whereas 360dialog charges a fixed $15/month instead of per message fees​
DOCS.OCTOPODS.IO
 (and you then just pay WhatsApp fees). If cost minimization is key and your volume is high, a provider like 360dialog or the direct Cloud API might be cheaper than Twilio in the long run. However, Twilio’s fee might be worth it for their reliable infrastructure and easier integration, especially at moderate volumes.
Example: If you send 10,000 WhatsApp messages/month via Twilio, Twilio’s fee is $50 (10k * $0.005)​
DOCS.OCTOPODS.IO
, plus Meta’s conversation charges (which might be, say, $30 if many are user-initiated or more if they’re business-initiated marketing). So maybe $80 total. With 360dialog, you’d pay $15 + ~$30 = $45 total for the same usage.
HighLevel Native WhatsApp Costs: HighLevel’s beta suggests they will resell WhatsApp messaging to agencies. According to HighLevel’s support, agencies can connect Stripe and resell WhatsApp to clients, with HighLevel billing a fixed base rate and the agency marking it up​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
. This implies HighLevel will charge the agency perhaps a monthly fee or per-message fee. The exact cost isn’t published in the snippet, but HighLevel might bundle it or charge for WhatsApp usage similarly to how it handles email (Mailgun) or phone (Twilio). If you go with HighLevel’s official integration, factor in those costs – it might be a convenience fee on top of Twilio/Meta fees. Using your own middleware means you pay only the provider (Twilio/Meta) costs, not any HighLevel surcharge.
Development and Hosting Costs: A self-hosted middleware has the upfront development time cost (if you’re a developer or hiring one). Hosting can be minimal – a small cloud VM or Heroku dyno might be $20-50/month depending on usage. If you anticipate high volume, you may need to scale it, but text messaging is not very heavy on bandwidth. Also consider the cost of secure storage of API keys (maybe use something like AWS Secrets Manager a few dollars a month). If you use a serverless approach (AWS Lambda, etc.), cost could be per execution but likely low unless volume is huge.
Third-party Integration Platform Costs: If you use something like Zapier, their pricing for a plan that handles real-time webhooks and a decent number of tasks can quickly exceed $100/month for substantial volume. Make.com (Integromat) might be cheaper for large operations, but still, each message might count as multiple operations (receive webhook, send API call, etc.). Pipedream is developer-friendly with generous free tiers for low volume, but for reliability you might need a paid plan. Over time, these costs can outstrip running your own server if message counts are in the thousands.
Opportunity Cost: There’s also the consideration of not doing this. SMS can be expensive in some countries, whereas WhatsApp might be cheaper or more effective. HighLevel’s Twilio SMS in the US might cost ~$0.0075 per SMS segment, which is comparable to WhatsApp costs in some cases. But if you have international leads, SMS could be $0.05+ each, whereas WhatsApp might still be <$0.01 in conversation cost. So shifting to WhatsApp could save messaging costs if your audience prefers it. On the other hand, if many of your contacts don’t use WhatsApp, you might still need SMS failsafes and end up paying for both channels in some cases.
To summarize: Twilio integration is easy but has per-message fees​
DOCS.OCTOPODS.IO
, direct integration (Cloud API) avoids third-party fees but requires more dev effort and management of Meta billing (which currently is free to get started except for conversation fees), and third-party middleware services have their own subscription costs. HighLevel’s official route might bundle things conveniently but likely at a marked-up price for profit (as suggested by their reselling model​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
). Evaluate your expected message volume and choose a cost model that scales well. If this is for a single business with moderate messaging, Twilio’s simplicity might be worth the small premium. If you’re an agency sending millions of messages on behalf of clients, saving $0.005 per message can mean thousands of dollars saved – which justifies a custom solution or alternative BSP.
Recommended Tools and Services
Based on the above, here are some recommended tools, services, and best practices for implementing the HighLevel-WhatsApp middleware:
HighLevel API & Developer Resources: Leverage HighLevel’s Developer Documentation (API 2.0 at developers.gohighlevel.com and their Slack channel for developers). There you can find how to set up a custom conversation provider or see examples of using the API. HighLevel’s Ideas forum also has threads (for example, requests to add WhatsApp to the conversation API​
IDEAS.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
) – these can give clues on capabilities. Also, use HighLevel’s Webhook action in workflows for quick integration tests, as it’s straightforward to send a POST with contact info​
HELP.GOHIGHLEVEL.COM
.
Twilio for WhatsApp: If going the Twilio route, Twilio is an excellent tool. It provides a unified API for SMS and WhatsApp, plus utilities like Sandbox (a WhatsApp sandbox to test with a Twilio-provided number), debugging logs, and support for templated messaging. Twilio’s docs on WhatsApp integration are very useful (covering opt-in, templates, etc.). Twilio also offers helper libraries (SDKs) in Node, Python, etc., which can simplify making API calls. For instance, using the Twilio Python SDK you can send a WhatsApp message with one function call. Remember to format phone numbers in the whatsapp:<E.164> format when sending through Twilio​
TWILIO.COM
. Twilio will handle queueing and retries to WhatsApp.
Meta WhatsApp Cloud API: If choosing direct integration, use the official WhatsApp Cloud API endpoints. Facebook’s Developer site provides Postman collections and examples. There are also community-built libraries (e.g., whatsapp-cloud-api for Node) that wrap the Graph API calls. The Cloud API requires you to secure your tokens and set up webhooks – consider using a framework like Express (for Node) or Flask (for Python) to easily create webhook endpoints. Tools like ngrok can help test webhooks locally by exposing your server to the internet during development.
Server and Middleware Tech Stack: Choose a stack you’re comfortable with. Node.js is popular for such integrations due to its event-driven nature (good for handling webhooks and making async API calls). A lightweight framework (Express, Fastify) would suffice. For Python, Flask or FastAPI can be used; Python also has strong HTTP client libraries (requests or httpx) to call the WhatsApp API. Ensure you use a secure method to store API keys (environment variables, not hard-coded). You might deploy on Heroku, AWS (EC2 or Lambda), Google Cloud Run, or any platform that supports your chosen language. If reliability is paramount, deploying in a high-availability setup (multiple instances behind a load balancer) could be considered, but for a start, a single instance with proper monitoring is fine.
Integration Platforms (if not coding): If you want to avoid hand-coding the entire middleware initially, consider n8n (which can be self-hosted for free). n8n allows you to create a workflow: “Webhook → HTTP Request (to WhatsApp API) → perhaps another HTTP Request (to HighLevel API)”. It has nodes for HTTP requests and you can script logic. Pipedream is another developer-friendly iPaaS: it lets you write Node.js code in the workflow steps, which might combine the best of both worlds (some coding but no server maintenance). These can be interim solutions or even long-term if they meet your needs. They also have built-in scheduling and logging which can be handy.
Monitoring and Logging Tools: Use logging to track message flows. Even a simple console log might suffice in development, but in production consider a logging service or saving logs to a file/DB. Also watch WhatsApp delivery rates and errors. Twilio’s console and alerting can notify you if messages start failing due to a banned number or other issues. If using Cloud API, the Business Manager analytics will show your quality rating and any policy issues. Set up an email alert if your WhatsApp number’s quality rating drops or if your HighLevel webhook starts erroring (HighLevel might email the account owner on persistent webhook failures).
Testing Tools: While developing, you can use WhatsApp’s sandbox (Twilio provides one where you join a sandbox via a code) to test sending messages to yourself. For the HighLevel side, use a test contact in a sandbox HighLevel account to avoid sending unintended messages to real leads. Tools like Postman can simulate HighLevel’s webhook calls to your middleware (useful to test your endpoint logic).
Security Considerations: Ensure your middleware API is secured since it will be receiving requests potentially containing sensitive data (customer phone numbers, message content). HighLevel’s custom webhook can be configured with authentication (it might allow setting an auth header or token). If not, implement a simple token check in the payload to verify the request is from HighLevel. Also, secure the WhatsApp webhook endpoint: it will include a verify token that you set in the Cloud API setup or be protected via Twilio’s signature. Always respond to HighLevel and WhatsApp webhooks with proper HTTP status codes (200 OK after processing) to avoid retries or failure flags.
Future-Proofing: Keep an eye on HighLevel’s own WhatsApp feature rollout. It might eventually allow a more straightforward integration or at least inspire ideas on improving your middleware. Also, WhatsApp is continually evolving – new features like list messages, reply buttons, etc., become available. Twilio and the Cloud API both support these interactive message types. If they’d benefit your use case (for example, using quick reply buttons for confirming appointments), consider implementing them once basic text messaging is stable. HighLevel might not know about these rich WhatsApp features, but you can still send them via the middleware (just note that the HighLevel conversation view might show the text of the button, but not the button UI – which is okay).
Recommended services summary: For the simplest reliable path – use Twilio’s WhatsApp API with a custom webhook provider in HighLevel. This leverages Twilio’s strong platform and HighLevel’s built-in Twilio hooks while only requiring moderate code in the middle (to format requests and handle replies). Ensure compliance by using WhatsApp-approved templates and track opt-ins carefully. If Twilio’s cost is a concern and you have development resources, consider using the WhatsApp Cloud API directly to avoid extra fees. In either case, HighLevel’s API + a custom middleware will give you a powerful combination to communicate on WhatsApp with all of HighLevel’s automation muscle behind it.
Conclusion
Integrating HighLevel with WhatsApp is a high-impact improvement that can boost contact response rates and provide richer communication, but it requires careful planning. By using HighLevel’s APIs and/or webhook capabilities, we can intercept outgoing SMS and route them through the WhatsApp Business API. The middleware approach – whether self-hosted or via a third-party – must maintain the continuity of HighLevel’s features: contact personalization, template usage, automated workflow triggers, and conversation tracking. We discussed how HighLevel’s architecture (with Twilio integration and custom providers) can be leveraged to insert our middleware in the loop​

, and how the WhatsApp API (through Twilio or directly via Meta) can be used to send messages reliably to users. Compliance with WhatsApp’s rules is non-negotiable: obtaining user opt-in and using approved templates for outbound messages will keep your account in good standing​

.With a robust middleware in place, HighLevel will treat WhatsApp messages much like SMS – agents can see the full conversation in one place and automations (campaigns, AI responses, etc.) can run as designed, simply on a different channel. The challenges like template management, syncing message statuses, and handling replies can be solved with the outlined strategies, ensuring a smooth experience. In terms of costs, WhatsApp messaging can be cost-effective compared to SMS in many cases, but one should weigh Twilio’s convenience fee​

 against running your own integration.By following the structured steps and best practices given, you can build a middleware app that effectively “overrides” SMS with WhatsApp in HighLevel. This allows you to reach contacts on WhatsApp – a channel with vastly higher read rates – without sacrificing the powerful marketing automation that HighLevel provides. The result is the best of both worlds: HighLevel’s templates, tracking, and workflows driving personalized outreach, delivered on a platform where customers are more likely to engage.
